def memoized_distance(v: str, w: str, memo: Dict[Tuple[str, str], int]) -> int:
    '''
    This Python function takes two strings v and w and a memoization dictionary memo, which maps pairs of strings to distances. The function returns the Levenshtein distance with transposition between the two strings, calculated recursively and memoized.

    The implementation is similar to the Java implementation. The function checks if the distance has already been memoized, and returns it if it has. If not, it calculates the distance using a recursive algorithm.

    The algorithm works as follows:

    If one of the strings is empty, the distance is the length of the other string.
    If the first characters of the strings are the same, the distance is the distance between the rest of the strings.
    Otherwise, the distance is the minimum of the distances of three subproblems: deleting the first character of the first string, deleting the first character of the second string, and swapping the first two characters of both strings (if they are different and the second characters match).
    The distance with transposition is the minimum of these three distances, plus 1.
    The algorithm memoizes the distances of subproblems using the memo dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

    distance_swap = memoized_distance(v[2:], w[2:], memo) if len(v) > 1 and len(w) > 1 and v[0] == w[1] and v[1] == w[0] else float('inf')

    # Memoize the minimum distance
    distance = 1 + min(distance_delete_v, distance_delete_w, distance_swap)
